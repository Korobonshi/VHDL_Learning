# My VHDL Learning Journey
Welcome! This Repository documents my exploration into the world of VHDL and digital logic design. It serves as a personal portfolio of the projects, exercises, and designs iI create as i develop my skills with FPGAs and hardware description languages.

What will be Inside? 
  - Foundational Concepts: Code covering VHDL fundamentals like entities, architectures, signals, processes, and data types.
  - Combinational & Sequential Logic: Implementations of basic circuits like multiplexers, decoders, adders, flip-flops, and counters.
  - Mini-Projects
  - Testbenches: Simulation files used to verify the functionality and timing of my VHDL modules.

## Goals
My primary goal is to build a strong foundation in digital design and gain practical experience for future projects. 
## Feel free to explore my code
